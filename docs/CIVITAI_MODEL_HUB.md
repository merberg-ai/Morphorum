# Civitai Model Hub roadmap

The optional Civitai Model Hub is developed on `feature/civitai-model-hub`. It is disabled by default.

## C1.0: Settings foundation (implemented)

Settings → Civitai Hub contains:
- Enable/disable preference (default off)
- Mature preview policy (default off)
- Preview thumbnail preference
- Automatic update-check preference (saved now, not yet scheduled)
- Grid/list layout and download concurrency preferences (saved now, used in later stages)
- **Test Connection** button: POST `/api/civitai/test-connection`

The connection test contacts Civitai only when explicitly clicked and only when the feature was **enabled and saved**. It sends no model hashes. A personal API token is optional and supplied to the host process using `CIVITAI_API_TOKEN` (environment variable), not browser settings. The API returns diagnostic status, but never the token or an upstream response body. The toggle is a preparatory feature flag; browser, download queue, and background checks do **not** exist in C1.0.

Existing local model browsing, generation, and opt-in LoRA Civitai lookup remain unchanged regardless of the Hub preference. Turning off the Hub does not delete existing files.

## Roadmap

- **C1.1**: Backend API client, search, model-type/base-family filters, pagination and disabled-state guards.
- **C1.2**: Responsive gallery; visible only when enabled.
- **C1.3**: Model versions, image gallery, metadata and compatibility information.
- **C2.1–C2.2**: Destination-aware download queue, progress, cancellation, resume, integrity checks; disabling Hub must stop or safely retire active Hub jobs.
- **C3.1–C3.3**: Local hash identification, updates, thumbnails, metadata sync and duplicate handling.
- **C4.1–C4.2**: Prompt/checkpoint integration and bulk management.

Only supported SDXL, FLUX and Z-Image runtime formats should be selectable for generation. Never overwrite existing external checkpoint/LoRA files without user approval.
